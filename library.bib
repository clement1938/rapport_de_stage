Smooth interpolation of unstructured surface data is usually achieved by joining local patches, where each patch is an approximation (usually parametric) defined on a local reference domain. A basic mesh-independent projection strategy for general surface interpolation is proposed here. The projection is based upon the 'Moving-Least-Squares' (MLS) approach, and the resulting surface is C oo smooth. The projection involves a first stage of defining a local reference domain and a second stage of constructing an MLS approximation with respect to the reference domain. The approach is presented for the general problem of approximating a (d-1)-dimensional manifold in IR d , d ?: 2. The approach is applicable for interpolating or smoothing curve and surface data, as demonstrated here by some graphical examples.},

In particular, this method is promising for simulations of multiphase and multi component fluid flow involving complex interfacial dynamics. Unlike the conventional CFD methods based on NS equations, the LBM is based on the mesoscopic particle's kinetic equation. This method has some advantages such as the simplicity of the algorithm (high efficiency on parallel processing), flexible reproduction of interfaces between phases. The conventional LBM, however, requires regular structured grids. But, for complex flow field, unstructured grids should be used. In this study, we describe a computational scheme based on two-dimensional unstructured grids using Cubic Interpolation with Volume/Area coordinates (CIVA) method and Adaptive Mesh Refinement method. As examples of tests of this scheme, single and two-phase flow simulations are presented.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to give a local tricubic interpolation scheme in three dimensions that is both C1 and isotropic. The algorithm is based on a specific 64 × 64 matrix that gives the relationship between the derivatives at the corners of the elements and the coefficients of the tricubic interpolant for this element. In contrast with global interpolation where the interpolated function usually depends on the whole data set, our tricubic local interpolation only uses data in a neighbourhood of an element. We show that the resulting interpolated function and its three first derivatives are continuous if one uses cubic interpolants. The implementation of the interpolator can be downloaded as a static and dynamic library for most platforms. The major difference between this work and current local interpolation schemes is that we do not separate the problem into three one-dimensional problems. This allows for a much easier and accurate computation of higher derivatives of the extrapolated field. Applications to the computation of Lagrangian coherent structures in ocean data are briefly discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

A parametric study of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equations is performed by post-processing existing large-eddy simulations at different operating conditions gathering subsonic, supersonic, cold, isothermal, and heated jets. It is concluded that using the pressure formulations of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equations yields better results than the density formulation, especially for the heated jet. In terms of surface closure, best results are obtained with closed surfaces, in conjunction with outflow disk averaging, which confirms the results obtained by Spalart and Shur in 2009. This is different from most previous studies, which recommend using open surfaces. In addition , detailed implementation information and quantified technical recommendations are presented as a guideline for post-processing large-eddy simulations for jet noise.},

   abstract = {A new boundary integral formulation is presented for the evaluation of the noise radiated in a uniform medium by generic sources. To use the method one requires knowledge of the pressure, velocity, and density disturbances on a smooth closed surface surrounding the source, and to assume that the propagation is linear outside the surface itself. When applied to the prediction of transonic rotor noise the method can be used in the same manner as the Kirchhoff approach, but the new integral equations are derived without requiring the non-penetration condition in the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. The method is therefore referred as The Kirchhoff-FWH. The main advantage of the proposed formulation in respect of the Kirchhoff method is that it does not require the knowledge of the surface pressure normal derivative. Additionally, it can be applied also for bodies with permeable surfaces, while the classical FWH equation is not valid in this case. Two different formulations are presented, which differ in the way in which a time derivative is handled, and some general issues on the numerical efficiency of the two formulations are addressed. Comparisons with experiments, and with Kirchhoff and FWH methods, are presented for a hovering rotor in transonic conditions at various tip Mach numbers.},

The presented approach consists of the coupling of several instances of the same LES unstructured solver through an overset grid method. A high-order interpolation, implemented within this coupling method, is introduced and evaluated on several test cases. It is shown to be third order accurate, to preserve the accuracy of various second and third order convective schemes and to ensure the continuity of diffusive fluxes and subgrid scale tensors even in detrimental interface configurations. In this analysis, three types of spurious waves generated at the interface are identified. They are significantly reduced by the high-order interpolation at the interface. The latter having the same cost as the original lower order method, the high-order overset grid method appears as a promising alternative to be used in all the applications.},

The off-body Cartesian mesh generation derives from an octree structure, assuming each octree leaf node defines a structured Cartesian block. This enables one to take into account the large scale discrepancies in terms of resolution between the different bodies involved in the simulation, with minimum memory requirements. Two different conversions from the octree to Cartesian grids are proposed: the first one generates Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) type grid systems, and the second one generates abutting or minimally overlapping Cartesian grid set. We also introduce an algorithm to control the number of points at each adaptation, that automatically determines relevant values of the refinement indicator driving the grid refinement and coarsening. An application to a wing tip vortex computation assesses the capability of the method to capture accurately the flow features. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We concentrate attention on the problem of curvilinearly coordinating simply connected planar domains W by constructing invertible maps of the unit square 9 = [0, 11 x [0, 11 onto 9. Extensions of the methods described herein to shells in 3-space is straightforward and is illustrated by a practical example taken from the automobile industry. Analogous mesh generators for three-dimensional solids can be developed on the basis of the trivariate 'blending-function' formulae found at the end of the second section. INTRODUCTION Inherent in any finite difference or finite element method for solving a boundary value problem over a non-rectangular domain 9 is the strategy for generating a partition or mesh on ~32. Whether rectangular, triangular, isoparametric,l transfinite2 or whatever other elements are to be used, the basic problem of where to place the nodes or mesh points must first be solved. If done manually, this involves a considerable expenditure of time and almost invariably results in a mesh for which a natural ordering of the nodes may not be apparent. The purpose of this paper is to describe an approach to automatic mesh generation based upon a systematic and unified class of schemes for treating the geometric aspects of the finite element method. Fundamental to our approach is the almost trivial observation that domains such as squares, ellipsoidal discs, spheres, circular cylinders and tori, for example, have intrinsic curvilinear coordinate systems (Reference 3, pp. 655-666) whose constant coordinate lines induce a natural rectilinear parametrization of the region. This much is classical. Very recently, Zienkiewicz and Phillips4 have shown how to construct curvilinear coordinate systems on regions whose boundaries are defined as low-order parametric polynomials. The essence of their scheme is the use of 'isoparametric' mappings to generate generalized coordinate systems on quadrilateral zones. In Reference 2 and below, the authors extend the work of Zienkiewicz and co-workers-and remove the 'element of chance' referred to in Reference 1, p. 109, from the derivation of the multivariate interpolation formulae which underlie the isoparametric techniques. We use the term 'transfinite' to describe the general class of interpolation schemes studied herein since, unlike the classical methods of higher dimensional interpolation which match the primitive function F at a finite number of distinct points, these methods match F at a non-denumerable (transfinite) number of points. Such a transfinite interpolatory mapping of a domain such as the unit square onto the domain of interest W induces a natural curvilinear coordinate system on W. The problem of mesh generation is that of locating a set of nodal points rg €9 appropriate to the problem at hand. It is in this sense that the mapping techniques studied herein provide the basis for mesh generation in 9. To be more specific, let r9 be a collection of nodes of some partition of Y into (for example) triangles and quadrilaterals. A one-to-one mapping U : Y+ 9, then provides the numerical values of the coordinates of the image in W of the nodes in the set r9 r# = U(r9). We refrain from calling the co-ordinatization techniques 'automatic' mesh generators since the actual problem of mesh definition must ultimately be resolved by the analyst who is cognizant of his specific application; that is, mesh generation involves both geometry and physics and in this paper we consider only the geometric aspects. In Reference 2 we discuss what we have termed transfinite element methods which presuppose a partitioning of W into transfinite subdomains \{gj\} and a set of univalent mappings \{Ti\} which map a set of canonical domains \{q.\} onto \{gj\}. Such a set of mappings \{Tj\} can be obtained as restrictions of a one-to-one mapping of the global canonical domain Y onto the entire domain 9, e.g. if \{q\} is a collection of subrectangles in Y such that Y = Uj T., then the images \{q\} will be transfinite subdomains in W and W = Uj 4. In this paper we do not explicitly pursue the topic of transfinite element methods and commend the reader to Reference 2. VECTOR-VALUED TRANSFINITE INTERPOLATION To begin, let us recall the geometric interpretation of the graph of a vector-valued function of two independent variables s and t F(s, t) = [xI(s, t), x2(s, t), * * * , xn(s, t)IT (1) As the variables s and t range over a domain Y in the s, t-plane R2, F(s, t) traces out a region W in Euclidean n-space, En. That is, F maps regions in R2 into regions in En F : R2-tEn (2) For the most part, we shall be concerned with continuous transformations F which map the unit square Y = [0,1] x [0,1] one-to-one onto a simply connected, bounded region W in E2 or E3. Such maps can be thought of as topological distortions of the planar region Y onto the two-dimensional manifold W, which is either a planar region (W = E2) or a surface embedded in 3-space (9 c E3).

Such a set of mappings \{Tj\} can be obtained as restrictions of a one-to-one mapping of the global canonical domain Y onto the entire domain 9, e.g. if \{q\} is a collection of subrectangles in Y such that Y = Uj T., then the images \{q\} will be transfinite subdomains in W and W = Uj 4. In this paper we do not explicitly pursue the topic of transfinite element methods and commend the reader to Reference 2. VECTOR-VALUED TRANSFINITE INTERPOLATION To begin, let us recall the geometric interpretation of the graph of a vector-valued function of two independent variables s and t F(s, t) = [xI(s, t), x2(s, t), * * * , xn(s, t)IT (1) As the variables s and t range over a domain Y in the s, t-plane R2, F(s, t) traces out a region W in Euclidean n-space, En. That is, F maps regions in R2 into regions in En F : R2-tEn (2) For the most part, we shall be concerned with continuous transformations F which map the unit square Y = [0,1] x [0,1] one-to-one onto a simply connected, bounded region W in E2 or E3. Such maps can be thought of as topological distortions of the planar region Y onto the two-dimensional manifold W, which is either a planar region (W = E2) or a surface embedded in 3-space (9 c E3). In either case a one-to-one (univalent) mapping Y + W is equivalent to the},

   abstract = {An all new, automated version of the PEGASUS software has been developed and tested. PEGASUS provides the hole-cutting and connectivity information between overlapping grids, and is used as the final part of the grid generation process for overset-grid computational fluid dynamics approaches. The new PEGASUS code (Version 5) has many new features: automated hole cutting; a projection scheme for fixing gaps in overset surfaces; more efficient interpolation search methods using an alternating digital tree; hole-size optimization based on adding additional layers of fringe points; and an automatic restart capability. The new code has also been parallelized using the Message-Passing Interface standard. The parallelization performance provides efficient speed-up of the execution time by an order of magnitude, and up to a factor of 30 for very large problems.},

   abstract = {A digital surface model (DSM) is an important geospatial infrastructure used in various fields. In this paper, we deal with how to improve the quality of DSMs generated from stereo image matching. During stereo image matching, there are outliers due to mismatches, and non-matching regions due to match failure. Such outliers and non-matching regions have to be corrected accurately and efficiently for high-quality DSM generation. This process has been performed by applying a local distribution model, such as inverse distance weight (IDW), or by forming a triangulated irregular network (TIN). However, if the area of non-matching regions is large, it is not trivial to interpolate elevation values using neighboring cells. In this study, we proposed a new DSM interpolation method using a 3D mesh model, which is more robust to outliers and large holes. We compared mesh-based DSM with IDW-based DSM and analyzed the characteristics of each. The accuracy of the mesh-based DSM was a 2.80 m root mean square error (RMSE), while that for the IDW-based DSM was 3.22 m. While the mesh-based DSM successfully removed empty grid cells and outliers, the IDW-based DSM had sharper object boundaries. Because of the nature of surface reconstruction, object boundaries appeared smoother on the mesh-based DSM. We further propose a method of integrating the two DSMs. The integrated DSM maintains the sharpness of object boundaries without significant accuracy degradation. The contribution of this paper is the use of 3D mesh models (which have mainly been used for 3D visualization) for efficient removal of outliers and non-matching regions without a priori knowledge of surface types.},

   abstract = {This work constitutes a fraction of a more extensive effort, which ultimate objective is the development of advanced aeroacoustics hybrid methods. Within this framework, we here focus on the interpolation step, on which generally rely all coupling processes that link altogether the various stages constituting any given hybrid method. In that regard, previous works by the present authors had revealed the intrinsic limitations and subsequent side effects (e.g., signal degradation) that weight on usual high-order interpolation schemes, whether the latter are of centered or noncentered nature, as well as optimized in an acoustic sense or not. Based on the outcomes of such study, here, a novel optimization technique for interpolation schemes is proposed. Such a technique, which is designed hereafter as the interpolation by parts (IBP), allows interpolating accurately a given signal, while minimizing its possible degradation. As a result, compared with its standard counterpart, any IBP-optimized interpolation scheme exhibits improved characteristics, such as a spurious modes generation that is greatly reduced (up to a 99% factor). Such improved characteristics are here validated on the basis of three test cases (of 1D, 2D and 3D nature), which illustrates the potentialities offered by the IBP optimization technique.},
