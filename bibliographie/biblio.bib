We present a mix of symbolic and numerical algorithms for low degree curve ets through points in the plane, surface ets through points and curves in space, and in general, hypersuface ets through points, curves, surfaces, and sub-varieties in n dimensional space. These interpolatory and or approximatory yts may also be made to match derivative information along all the sub varieties. Such multi-dimensional hyper-surface interpolation and approximation provides mathematical models for scattered data sampled in three or higher dimensions and can be used to compute volumes, gradients, or more uniform samples for easy and realistic visualization.},

Smooth interpolation of unstructured surface data is usually achieved by joining local patches, where each patch is an approximation (usually parametric) defined on a local reference domain. A basic mesh-independent projection strategy for general surface interpolation is proposed here. The projection is based upon the 'Moving-Least-Squares' (MLS) approach, and the resulting surface is C oo smooth. The projection involves a first stage of defining a local reference domain and a second stage of constructing an MLS approximation with respect to the reference domain. The approach is presented for the general problem of approximating a (d-1)-dimensional manifold in IR d , d ?: 2. The approach is applicable for interpolating or smoothing curve and surface data, as demonstrated here by some graphical examples.},

Three interpolation methods-linear, inverse distance weighted (IDW), and Kriging interpolation methods-are presented and explored. The methods are evaluated by performing interpolations using a non-uniformly spaced database of AS-202 vehicle forebody solutions and over a CEV-shaped capsule with a 3-D, uniformly-spaced database. The linear method is simple, robust, and an acceptable choice of interpolation for rough first estimates or if the database solution variables depend linearly on design space variables.},

In particular, this method is promising for simulations of multiphase and multi component fluid flow involving complex interfacial dynamics. Unlike the conventional CFD methods based on NS equations, the LBM is based on the mesoscopic particle's kinetic equation. This method has some advantages such as the simplicity of the algorithm (high efficiency on parallel processing), flexible reproduction of interfaces between phases. The conventional LBM, however, requires regular structured grids. But, for complex flow field, unstructured grids should be used. In this study, we describe a computational scheme based on two-dimensional unstructured grids using Cubic Interpolation with Volume/Area coordinates (CIVA) method and Adaptive Mesh Refinement method.},

Then, to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm, we solve two-dimensional benchmark problems of incompressible lid-driven recirculating flow in square and triangular cavities. In addition, a two-dimensional vortex-driven flow is solved in order to analyze the conservative property of CIVA. Finally, an example of an industrial application of CIVA method is described. These numerical experiments demonstrate the high capability of the method and that it is sufficiently robust for complex industrial applications.},

The presented approach consists of the coupling of several instances of the same LES unstructured solver through an overset grid method. A high-order interpolation, implemented within this coupling method, is introduced and evaluated on several test cases. It is shown to be third order accurate, to preserve the accuracy of various second and third order convective schemes and to ensure the continuity of diffusive fluxes and subgrid scale tensors even in detrimental interface configurations. In this analysis, three types of spurious waves generated at the interface are identified. They are significantly reduced by the high-order interpolation at the interface. The latter having the same cost as the original lower order method, the high-order overset grid method appears as a promising alternative to be used in all the applications.},

In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of a standard conservative interpolation scheme compared to the more sophisticated cut-volume cell by applying the schemes to aeroacoustic computation of an axial fan. Finally, the results of the acoustics simulations are compared to measurements.},

This enables one to take into account the large scale discrepancies in terms of resolution between the different bodies involved in the simulation, with minimum memory requirements. Two different conversions from the octree to Cartesian grids are proposed: the first one generates Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) type grid systems, and the second one generates abutting or minimally overlapping Cartesian grid set. We also introduce an algorithm to control the number of points at each adaptation, that automatically determines relevant values of the refinement indicator driving the grid refinement and coarsening.},

First, thanks to theoretical investigations, we analyze the interpolation process and the mechanisms underlying its two main issues, which are the spurious modes generation and the signal degradation. The former is then more particularly studied, before an innovative interpolation technique is proposed for minimizing its effects. This innovative procedure is then assessed/validated against several test cases of increasing complexity.

We concentrate attention on the problem of curvilinearly coordinating simply connected planar domains W by constructing invertible maps of the unit square. Extensions of the methods described herein to shells in 3-space is straightforward and is illustrated by a practical example taken from the automobile industry.},

% abstract = {A digital surface model (DSM) is an important geospatial infrastructure used in various fields. In this paper, we deal with how to improve the quality of DSMs generated from stereo image matching. During stereo image matching, there are outliers due to mismatches, and non-matching regions due to match failure. Such outliers and non-matching regions have to be corrected accurately and efficiently for high-quality DSM generation. This process has been performed by applying a local distribution model, such as inverse distance weight (IDW), or by forming a triangulated irregular network (TIN). However, if the area of non-matching regions is large, it is not trivial to interpolate elevation values using neighboring cells. In this study, we proposed a new DSM interpolation method using a 3D mesh model, which is more robust to outliers and large holes. We compared mesh-based DSM with IDW-based DSM and analyzed the characteristics of each.},
